#SOLO Mapper's companion computer
Here is the code for the Raspberry Pi, the companion computer accompanying the SOLO Mapper's expansion bay to ensure the link between the equipments and allow the collect and geotag the pictures once the mission is cleared. The computer checks if every photos has been taken. You’ll never get pictures you can’t geotag because of some missed shots. When the flight’s over, just grab the SDcard and copy the geotagged images, ready to use in your favorite photogrammetry software such as Pix4D, Photoscan, Smart3DCapture,


## SOLO Mapper

The 3DR SOLO is now a reference in the “open-source drone” industry. This version of the Solo has been developped to allow you to create flight plans dedicated to cartography and 2D/3D mapping thanks to free and cross-plateform softwares/apps

We integrated different tools to transform the inital SOLO into a mapping UAV :

* A powerful camera : the SONY QX1 (lightweight, powerful, precise, without distortion)
* A live video feed integrated directly into the SOLO and TOWER apps and MISSION PLANNER
* A 2 axis servo gimbal,  ultra light and adjustable from the SOLO Controller
* Another integrated micro computer to automatically collect and geotag the pictures.
